Q1.
The major difference between the TCP Client and Server is that the client connects to the server while the server binds itself to a specific port.
this will allow the server to receive any packets sent to it on the port specified and allows the server to handle all clients that connect to it.


Q2. 
The major difference between TCP Server and UDP Server is that a UDP connect is connectionless so when it's bound to a port it doesn't care who sends the packet.
when the packet is sent if the UDP server doesn't handle it (packet gets lost) the UDP connection won't care. 
The TCP Connection would keep retrying until the correct packet is received.
