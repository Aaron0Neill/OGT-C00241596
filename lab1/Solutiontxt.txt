Practical Subnetting:
	Problem 4: 
		Ip Address						:135.126.0.0
		Address Class					:B
		Custom subnet mask				:255.255.240.0
		Minimum number of subnets needed: 5 + 70% = 8.5 -> 9subnets (4 bits)
		Number of host addresses in the 
		largetst subnet group			:325 + 70% = 552.5 -> 553
		
		IP address range for New York	:135.126.0.0 to 135.126.15.255
		IP address range for Washington	:135.126.16.0 to 135.126.31.255
		IP address range for Dallas		:135.126.32.0 to 135.126.47.255
		IP address range for Router A
		to Router B serial				:135.126.48.0 to 135.126.63.255
		Ip address range for Router A
		to Router C serial				:135.126.64.0 to 135.126.79.255
		
	Problem 6:
		IP Address						:10.0.0.0
		Address Class					:A
		Custom subnet mask				:255.0.0.0
		Minimum subnets needed			:7 + 20% = 8.4 -> 9
		total number of subnets needed	:16(4bits)

		IP Address ranges:
