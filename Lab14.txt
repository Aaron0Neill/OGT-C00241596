a) 
No latency can not be eliminated completely, latency is just a part of computers
no matters what we do there will be a latency, we can get that to a point where we
can't notice it but unfortunately we cant remove it entirely.

b)
if a player is lagging really bad and the game is designed poorly, the player could
potentially run peak around a corner and shoot, then peak back in, on the players screen
he would obviously be able to move around the corner see another player, shoot and peak back
but if there was a latency issue the server could be delayed in receiving infromation about 
the players position and he could be back behind cover before the server has received the 
information that he was around the corner.

c)
the dumb client belongs to the conservative category as it implies strict limitations on 
how the game will be updated.
Client-side prediction is a blend of the optimisitc category as it allows for local movement 
on the players side but alos allows the server to check fix any issues that appear at a later time.
