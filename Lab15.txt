A)
There is several ways of cheating, it all depends on the game. One way to cheat
in a game called cookie clicker is to get a software that simulates mouse clicks
(usually at a speed humans can't) so they can get an unfair advantage by collecting
an amount that shouldn't be possible.
One way to prevent this would be by checking to see how often the user clicks, usally
software will click at a given time, so every 100ms it will click, so if the number of clicks
per second is exactly the same you can confirm it's not a human doing it.

Another way to cheat in fps games is to get a software that will hook into the messaging system 
for the game and reveal the locations of the players on the opposite team and show the player. 
either through visuals through the wall or markers on the map. The way most games combat this
is with an anti-cheat software as well as a system where when players report someone they get reviewed 
by other humans and they determine if the actions are humanly possible or not.

B)
A potentially visible set is something the game has flagged that should be sent across,
that means it's something close to the player, just behind a wall etc. It is something that can change 
and could be sent across. 
Static zones are areas like buildings, or even players that are too far away from the player to but updated.
Interest management is very beneficial to games, as it helps prevent cheaters from learning the positions of players
that are really far from the main user. 
It also helps cut down on the amount of bandwidth needed.
