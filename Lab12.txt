Lab 12.

A)
Client/Server
ADV.
    Client server will allow a more stable connection, i.e in a P2P connection if one of the 
    connections drop, maybe the host all the people connectioned would crash out as they are
    no longer receieving information. With a Client/Server connection even if 50% of the clients
    drop the server will still be able to send data between the 50% that remain.
DISADV.
    Client server are more costly as you have to setup servers anywhere you want there to be
    a stable connection, if you only want players in ireland to be able to connect, you could
    just set up a server in Dublin and be fine, but someone in Russia would have terrible latency
    conencting to the server, so you need servers spread around. 

P2P
ADV.
    Peer to peer is a cheaper solution, since you can build the connection straight into the game,
    anyone can be the host and anyone can be the client. It can have a much shorter setup time.
DISADV.
    Each Node on the connection can both send and receive which can take up a lot of resources, 
    it would be great for a small 5v5 game, but once the number of players starts to increase the
    strain on each peer gets greater which can result in bottlenecks.

B)
In a peer-to-peer connection, the client will connect to the host and once the host and client have
successfully connected then the host will reveal all the other clients to the new connection.

Diagram
    P1
      \
        Host
P1 and the host have successfully formed a connection, then a P2 joins
    P1        P2
      \      /
        Host
Once P2 successfully joins to the host, the host will inform P2 of P1 and they will form a connection
then.
    P1--------P2
      \      /
        Host

C)
Hole-punching is a technique that is employed when the user wishes to try and make a direct connection
with another peer, in this case when there is "port restriction", 
Hole punching is when you temporarily use a server to acquire the relevant information needed for a
direct connection from the other peer. 
So you both connect to the server with UUID's, one client tries to connect to the peer he wishes
to try get a direct connection with. 
You then send packed to the the peer, knowing it won't make it to them.
Then the peer attempts to send you a pacet which will get through as your network is waiting for 
a response.
Once you get the response you will have all the needed information to connect directly.
